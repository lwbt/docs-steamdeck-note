# What is this?

This a repository, but actually just a bunch of notes in markdown format. Even
though it is a GIT repository you should not depend on it in its current form. I
may turn it into a Wiki, something like [Root Pages][1], a monorepo or something
different.

You should start reading [FAQ.md](./FAQ.md)
