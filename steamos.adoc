== SteamOS and running SteamOS on other devices
:tag-recovery: https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/1B71-EDF2-EB6D-2BB3
:tag-holoiso: https://github.com/theVakhovskeIsTaken/holoiso

=== HoloISO

A common fallacy is that one needs a Steam Deck device to run SteamOS. Many will
give you misleading advice and this excuse, which is not true. Wikipedia notes
that SteamOS version 1 and 2 were based on Debian. A Debian based SteamOS 3 was
apparently in the works but never published, an Arch Linux based version was
published instead. You could download the older versions of SteamOS intended for
Steam Machines directly from Valve, but the documents seem to be outdated and
still refer to APT repositories and Debian or Ubuntu.

// TODO: rewrite this section to separate recovery and Holo
You can find up to date {tag-recovery}[Recovery Instructions], which some
community members converted into standard ISOs and offering them as
{tag-holoiso}[HoloISO]. I hope I got that right. I need to look into how they
do this when I have time.

Speculation on my side: They finally wanted to deliver a product with recent
components and have control over the source without getting to involved with
the technical boards of the major 3 Linux vendor ecosystems in the corporate
market (Red Hat, Suse, Ubuntu/Debian). They probably hired new talent with Arch
Linux experience. Steam had been ported to Flatpak already and Google was quite
successful with their Gentoo based ChromeOS platform 2. Enough with gossip
which I have no sufficient proof for.

So there is a way, but people will find excuses too.

=== Bazzite

A new project based on Fedora Universal Blue, like Silverblue and Kinoite,
emerged in 2023:

https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite/

It is now possible to get a Gnome Desktop instead while maintaining the Steam
Deck Game Mode experience.

My research so far:

   rampant, but reasonable.)

=== Recovery

// TODO: rewrite this section
{tag-recovery}[Recovery Instructions]

=== How to recover/restore/migrate from another Steam Deck?

It looks like there is no functionality to transfer or migrate data from one
device to another. Although Sony Playstation and Microsoft Xbox offer such a
functionality. So it is not unreasonable to ask. It has just not been
implemented yet by Valve or a community member.

== Basics, guides and resources

* https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/671A-4453-E8D2-323C[Steam Deck Desktop FAQ]
* Desktop Mode: long press the power button and select **Switch to Desktop**
* Leave Desktop Mode: use the logout desktop icon on the desktop or Application
  Launcher menu or press the power button
* Bring up the on-screen keyboard: press the kbd:[Steam+X] buttons

== Storage Management

To better keep track of SD Cards:

* Settings -> Storage -> MicroSD Card -> Options -> Rename Library
** I recommend using `DECK SD $LETTER`, where $LETTER is a letter from A to Z
** Continue the scheme with `AA, AB, AC [...]`
* `sudo tune2fs -L "DECK-SD-$LETTER" /run/media/deck/...`
** A host device will also mount a volume under this given label in the future
   instead of a ver long UUID.

Using `DECK SD $LETTER` and `DECK-SD-$LETTER` helps distinguishing if a name is
sourced from a Steamd VDF file of from the file system label.

== Applications

=== Syncthing

See: link:steamos_launcher_items.adoc#syncthing-on-chromium[Launcher Items]

=== ScummVM

See: link:steamos_launcher_items.adoc#scummvm[Launcher Items]

=== Music and media players

* MPV for movies with a comfortable gum alias
** I included this functionality in my `sdm.sh` script along with functionality
   to play songs and albums
* Lollypop for music: link:steamos_launcher_items.adoc#lollypop[Launcher Items]

=== Heroic Game Launcher
:tag-heroic-bash-launcher: https://github.com/redromnon/HeroicBashLauncher/wiki/Steam-Deck-(Flatpak)-Guide
:tag-flatseal: https://github.com/lwbt/docs-steamdeck-notes/blob/main/steamos.adoc#flatpak-overrides-and-flatseal

In desktop mode open the Software Center (KDE Discover) and search for Heroic,
then install it. It is a Launcher which gives you access to the Epic Games store
and GOG store. You can get free games which you normally have to pay for in the
Epic Games store. Most of the games run on Linux, but it depends on the
publisher. Fortnite can be installed, but does not run, it requires to have
anticheat programs running which don't like or don't expect what SteamOS does
with Wine and Proton.

Adding games from Heroic to Steam can be done through a shell script named
{tag-heroic-bash-launcher}[HeroicBashLauncher]. It can also be done through the
add **add a game** button in the Steam desktop client and selecting the
respective desktop shortcut which you might need to create first from the tools
tab of the respective game in Heroic. Recently an new feature was added to each
game page to add it to Steam.

You might need to install and configure settings in {tag-flatseal}[Flatseal]
for this app.

=== Installation and use of Proton GE and other Compatibility Tools
:tag-proton-ge: https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom
:tag-rps-proton-ge: https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-proton-ge-on-the-steam-deck
:tag-proton-upgt: https://flathub.org/apps/details/net.davidotek.pupgui2

{tag-proton-ge}[Proton GE] is a customized build of Proton.

Open the Software Center (KDE Discover) in desktop mode and search for
{tag-proton-upqt}[ProtonUp-Qt], then install it. Run the program in desktop
mode to let it install the latest Proton GE version. You could add the program
as a game in steam if you feel the need to access it quickly and don't mind
clutter, like I did for the terminal application. From the Steam UI you will be
able to set Proton GE as the runtime environment once the initial setup and
download are done. Desktop mode Steam settings and Steam UI settings seem to be
independent.

==== Strategy for installing and updating Compatibility Tools

* Steam: Tools below are only available and updatable through ProtonUp-Qt
** GE-Proton: installed
** Boxtron: not installed
** Luxtorpeda: not installed
** Proton Tkg: not installed
** Roberta: not installed
** SteamTinkerLaunch: not installed
* Heroic Wine: Nothing installed here or managed with Heroic or ProtonUp-Qt
  since Heroic is able to detect tools installed in Steam name space. Avoid
  management overhead and disk space cruft by installing and updating all
  possible tools in all possible places when possible.
** Lutris is only available here for Steam and Heroic, but if you have serious
   problems with a game, debugging in Bottles looks like the most constructive
   option.
* Heroic Proton: Same as above.
* Bottles: Tools below are primarily available through Bottles you'll make a
  mess when you use ProtonUp-Qt. You can find them through the menu button
  (three bars) -> Preferences -> **Runners**.
** caffe: installed
** lutris: installed
** soda: installed
** vaniglia: installed
** GE Wine: installed
** GE-Proton: not installed

=== Installation and use Bottles
:tag-flathub-bottles: https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.usebottles.bottles
:tag-bottles-first: https://docs.usebottles.com/getting-started/first-run

Bottles is available from {tag-flathub-bottles}[Flathub] and thus on SteamOS.
Installing your {tag-bottles-first}[first app] is simple, you select an
environment from the presets games, app or custom and select to run the
installer of your choice. If the App is not terribly broken then it will run
just fine. Done!

=== Media Server Jellyfin and streaming

You can install https://flathub.org/apps/org.jellyfin.JellyfinServer[Jellyfin
Server] and set it up for your needs. Be sure to set a password, I tried
without and failed the first time I attempted to set it up.

Steam Link can be found in the settings, but it doesn't work with devices which
don't run popular apps, like Samsungs Tizen.

https://github.com/skorokithakis/catt[catt] might be a solution instead of
buying an additional Chromecast.

=== Flatpak overrides and Flatseal

Existing flatpak overrides can be exported from and imported to the following
directory: `$HOME/.local/share/flatpak/overrides/`

Noteworthy examples in heredoc format for copy and pasting:

[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p "$HOME/.local/share/flatpak/overrides"

tee "$HOME/.local/share/flatpak/overrides/org.scummvm.ScummVM" << 'EOF'
[Context]
filesystems=~/Games
EOF

=== Where and how to report compatibility issues?

[quote,https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/new/choose]
____
add `PROTON_LOG=1 %command%` to the game's launch options and attach the
generated $HOME/steam-$APPID.log

=== Heroic: Epic Games Store and GOG

Epic Games:

* Shadow of Tomb Raider, apparently does not launch with DX12 mode

GOG:

* Tomb Raider 1+2+3
** Controller mappings: https://www.thekinsie.com/words/tombraider/
** Been unable to launch Tomb Raider 3 yet
** Tomb Raider 5 seems to work fine

== Known issues with hardware

=== Monitors with USB-C input work but integrated USB hubs and attached devices don't work

That is the YMMV part. I have two Dell U2720Q. One had firmware M2T101 and the
other firmware M2T104. The latter can be upgraded to newer firmware, the other
can apparently not and USB devices are not detected on the device with the
older firmware while the newer has no problems and works just fine.

== Linux settings and dotfiles

I'm used to more friendlier configuration of aliases and command completion from
Debian and Ubuntu. This is typical for other distributions.

TODO: link dotfiles repo here.

While SteamOS should be treated like an appliance investigation which parts
could be handled through Ansible configuration management should be evaluated.

== Passwordless `sudo` access

Ideally you should not need this. Especially if you don't understand what sudo
is and how you can recover from a faulty sudoers configuration, which is beyond
the scope of this document.

[source,bash]
----
# Set a temporary sudo password like 123456 for current user deck
passwd
# Configure passwordless sudo access for users in the wheel group
echo "%wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" \
| sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/wheel >/dev/null
# Remove the temporary password for the user deck
sudo passwd -d deck
