Steam Deck = The overpowered media player you dreamed of 20 years ago.

== What is this?
:tag-rootpages: https://rootpages.lukeshort.cloud/
:tag-obsidian: https://obsidian.md/

This a repository, but actually just a bunch of notes in markdown or ASCIIDOC
format. Even though it is a GIT repository you should not depend on it in its
current form. I may turn it into a Wiki, something like {tag-rootpages}[Root
Pages], {tag-obsidian}[Obsidian], a monorepo or something different.

=== Status: Windows

* Should be cleaned up a bit
* Windows installation is fine so far for my needs
** `windows_drivers` contains a script to download the last known to work
   drivers
** `windows_installation` contains scripts to be run right after the initial
   boot to set up things
** `windows_installation\config` contains a few configuration files or assets
   for the initial setup, everything beyond that should be handled in dotfiles
* Mostly used to run games from Epic Games Store. Sorry if you expected the
  perfect setup.
** link:windows.md#can-the-epic-games-launcher-detect-previously-installed-games[Restore Games]
   should allow for quick recovery when an installation has issues without
   downloading a lot of content again.

Going forward this will be my only Windows installation that I keep around and
I will not use it much. Thank you Valve for making Windows almost obsolete for
an occasional gamer like me, and for improving Wine and developing Proton.

=== Status: Linux

[NOTE]
Using a terminal in game mode to me feels like using what could have been a
well rounded Windows 8 experience.

* Drive is unencrypted and I will not change the partition layout myself right now
* Dotfiles (private repo) are messy and need to be restructured
* Flatpaks are fine

== Tinkering with SteamOS aka ¬ªDon't have a Steam Deck¬´

TODO: consolidate with the other section:
link:steamos.adoc#running-steamos-on-other-devices--holoiso[HoloISO]

Put https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/[Ventoy] on a USB drive or SD card, and
put the HoloISO ISO file onto it. Boot it. Now you see what Steam OS is like.
Requires a general purpose computer obviously, not a Chromebook or anything
with an ARM chip. For now. Installation to hard drive can be done, but I guess
the developer needs a hand getting UEFI to work.
