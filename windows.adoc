== Running Windows on Steam Deck

* Download Rufus
* Download a Windows image of your choice from Microsoft
** `quickget` from https://github.com/quickemu-project/quickemu can help you!
* Get an empty hard drive and make selections in Rufus to install Windows as
  Windows to Go from the image you downloaded before
* Power down and boot your Steam Deck while holding to Volume Up button, which
  will bring up the boot menu where you can choose to boot from the external
  drive
* Install Windows drivers:

== Personal opinion about Windows 11 and usage policy as a secondary OS

Quite usable, not as annoying as the moving tiles in the Windows 10 and 8 start
menu. I guess that was a fad and many frequent users of Windows 10 were more
annoyed by invasive marketing than I thought there would be. Still more than a
row of shortcuts to I apps I don't want to use, but they are not preinstalled
and can be removed easily. At best one of the existing scripts can be updated,
but I should brush up my PowerShell knowledge first.

Avoid installing too many things. Use the standard zip tool and editor. Install
games that don't run in SteamOS to run them and nothing else. Do Micromanagement
when you have time.

== Usermode controller driver

Install the latest MSI package from here:
https://github.com/mKenfenheuer/steam-deck-windows-usermode-driver/releases

== Configure Windows to use UTC

== Remove features and unwanted software

Apparently this is still active and enabled in 2022 despite numerous CVEs.

== More tinkering with Windows

Some people invested more time than me, non-surprisingly, and published more
stuff since Steam Deck became generally available.

I prefer to keep my repo small (no blobs), and I didn't have time to check all
the content yet, but I might need to do that to keep up to date.

== Where is the tabbed explorer in Win11?

It will be available when you install version H22 of Windows 11 and install the
latest updates, it's not included out of the box.

== Some research on Powershell

Some parts got lost somewhere, here are the parts that have survived:
