== General

=== Who is this for?

Me. I'm a Linux systems administrator and engineer.

=== What is this about?

This is a repository of semi-structured notes I wrote while configuring my Steam
Deck gaming console.

=== Why is it written this way?

After reading blog posts from Dan Luu, listening to the ReWork podcast and some
others I thought it was an idea to try out. So it's me talking to myself
naively about technology in public without trying to create a stage. Just to
get better at writing and organizing. I wrote some things on StackExchange some
time ago which would also benefit from improving my writing.

It's a repository for things I don't want to keep in my head or in a todo list.

== Considerations

=== Is there a battery life extender? Aka stop charging at 80%.

[quote,https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/69E3-14AF-9764-4C28]
____
If your device has been left on the charger for long periods of time, it may
report less than 100% charge. This is normal. We allow the battery to slowly
discharge after long periods of time under charge to optimize long-term battery
health.
____

So It can be considered "safe" for the battery life to leave it plugged in and
docked, it won't top up the battery like crazy. The 80% thing may be a
marketing gimmick from Apple and other manufacturers.

=== Should I reduce the EXT4 reserved blocks count on Steam Deck?

No. The reserved blocks count, which is typically set to 5%, is set to 0 on
Steam Deck.

**Note:** This is an interesting experiment from my point of view/ because some
people advised against my advice to reduce from 5% to 0.5% or lower with
`tune2fs`. I trust Valve's developers on this one, but I should research where
the 5% default originated and what purpose it serves. Many customers and admins
are not aware of this.

=== Is there any benefit in researching to choose different filesystems?
:tag-btrfs-script: https://gitlab.com/popsulfr/steamos-btrfs

Probably not. Someone wrote a {tag-btrfs-script}[script to convert the home
partition to Btrfs], but we will have to see how that plays out during future
platform upgrades. For the default Valve should have a plan to not brick their
customers systems and make them start from scratch. That lost time and money
may outweigh potential performance improvements and storage savings. Additional
microSD cards are on sale from time to time. That's good enough for me. Want to
go beyond that?  Setting up USB-C NVME or HDD drives should be possible with
reasonable effort.

You can do encryption with EXT4 as far as I know. XFS is default for RHEL, but
we are not running a RHEL server here. Recent Fedora chose to use Btrfs and I
think ChromeOS also makes use of it somewhere. Definitely not trying out ZFS on
Steam Deck, although I like it.

=== Is there any benefit on replacing the internal SSD?

I have the 512 GB model. While you could do it, you would need to find an M.2
2242 drive with better performance in the same power and temperature budget. I
wish it was easier, but finding such drives is not easy for me at the moment.
I'm still looking for a replacement of my Toshiba RC-100 drive in a different
device and I can't find one. Single sided or double sided? B-key, M-key or
B&M-Key? Not with investigating this at the moment.

=== How to reduce installation size of games?

Example: Forza Horizon 5 is over 100GB in size.

There is no standardized way at the moment as it seems. Some users suggested
ambiguously deleting files they think are safe to delete, like very high
resolution assets, but this is not safe and steam will report that the game
content is inconsistent when performing a check and starting downloads. A bad
idea that multiplies and gets worse when you have a few more titles which
frequently receive content updates.

Games like Fortnite on the other hand--when I run it on Windows 2 GO on the
Steam Deck--provide an option to remove or not download high resolution content
which optimizes for smaller or low powered devices. But Microsoft and other
publishers seem to assume that a Steam client is a PC and if it downloads some
title it must be a high performance workstation. Steam Deck is somewhere in
between a Nintendo Switch and an Xbox Series S and I'm sure many who claim
themselves to be gamers have hardware with comparable performance and should not
have to shell out money to download and store content they don't need right now.
I have probably used to much Linux package management and gaming consoles to
criticize this here. We will see. Microsoft claim that their Smart Delivery can
do wonderful things, but a video by MVG gives me the impression that
optimization was an after thought and it's mostly about DRM.

**Note:** Needs more research, I'm probably just using inappropriate search
terms and filters.

=== Can I run monitoring?

Sounds like an interesting idea from an infrastructure admin point of view. Not
sure about that, may be we can install Netdata in some way and gain some
insights through metrics. Steam Deck has a performance overlay which does what
gaming journalists expect though.

Creating a shortcut for Konsole and have it run `btop` is the best solution for
now.

=== Can I run emulation?

Besides RetroArch for various things there seems to be EmuDeck particularly
made for Steam Deck.

=== Can I run games bought from the Origin or GOG store on Steam Deck?

Yes.

See: link:steamos.adoc#heroic-epic-games-store-and-gog[Heroic]

=== Can I run games bought from the Nintendo store?

No.

Read carefully here. I own a Nintendo Switch, I bought some games there, some of
them are not Nintendo exclusives while others are free to play. It would have
been nice to run some of them legally with minimal effort, like for example
Fortnite. It is not possible or reasonable for me and I accept that.

=== Can I modify the controller inputs?

Yes, in desktop mode open the steam client, select Steam from the menu and go to
Controller. You can change the layout, button mappings and all other possible
attributes there.

I change to the default layout, which was not default on SteamOS, for which I
swapped PGUP and PGDN, set mouse acceleration on the trackpad to high und
reduced haptic feedback.

=== How do I decrypt Syncthing folders?

I wrote a script called `stdec`.

See the following thread for decrypting single files:
https://forum.syncthing.net/t/can-i-decrypt-a-single-file-or-a-selection-of-files-from-an-untrusted-folder/20622

Remember that you need to give filesystem access to `/dev/shm` and
`$HOME/SYCTHING_DECRYPTED/folder` to Flatpak apps that should access these
files.

== Troubleshooting

=== How to replay the Guided Tour?

Game Mode Options Menu -- via kbd:[···] -> Help -> Replay Guided Tour

=== Where to I report bugs?

Game Mode Options Menu -- via kbd:[···] -> Help -> Report a Bug

link:steamos.adoc#where-and-how-to-report-compatibility-issues[Where and how to report compatibility issues?]

=== My games look like Pixel Art, but not in desktop mode

You have enabled half rate shading in the power menu, disabled it.

=== How do I fix overscan on TVs and Beamers?

Go to Settings -> Display. Disable Automatically Scale image and adjust the
size on the bar that has now appeared.

=== Grub, Ventoy and other bootloaders start up in portrait mode

A comment in `/etc/default/grub` on SteamOs explains that `1280x800x32` is the
correct resolution, however Ventoy starts with `800x1280x32`, which can be
changed through F5:Tools -> Resolution Configuration.

The following is supposed to work for Windows, but I had no luck on Windows 11 22H2:

=== Can I mount LUKS encrypted volumes?

[source,bash]
----
if [[ -z $(grep --extended-regexp \
     'GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=".+(module_blacklist=tpm).+"' \
     "/etc/default/grub") ]]; then
  sudo sed --in-place=".$(date +%F_%H-%M-%S)_luks.bak" \
    's/module_blacklist=tpm //g' \
    "/etc/default/grub"
  sudo update-grub
else
  echo -e "Nothing to do. GRUB has already been updated."
fi
reboot

sudo modprobe dm_crypt

At the time I was searching for a solution I found the links below helpful, but
the content seems to have been removed, which proves my point that
StackExchange is better suited for such things.

=== Can I enable IOMMU?

Yes. See: https://github.com/Smalls1652/steamdeck-iommu-fix/blob/main/enable-iommu.sh

Here is a shorter version of the script:

     'GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=".+(amd_iommu=on iommu=pt).+"' \
     "/etc/default/grub") ]]; then

    's/amd_iommu=off/amd_iommu=on iommu=pt/g' \
    "/etc/default/grub"
  sudo update-grub
else
  echo -e "Nothing to do. GRUB has already been updated."
fi
